DocSynthAI – Intelligent Document Processing MCP Server

🌟 About DocSynthAI

DocSynthAI is an open-source Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) engine powered by the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
It is built to make unstructured documents understandable, extractable, validatable, and machine-ready — using AI, NLP, OCR, and rule-based business logic.

✨ What DocSynthAI Does
🔹 Transforms unstructured documents into structured intelligence

DocSynthAI reads any document (PDF, Image, Scanned copy, Docx) and converts it into clean, normalized, business-friendly data.

🔹 Acts as an MCP Server

So any LLM, ChatGPT client, agentic system, or automation pipeline can connect and process documents seamlessly.

🔹 Provides a modular, pluggable IDP Pipeline

Each stage is designed as a pluggable unit:

OCR

Layout detection

Classification

Entity extraction

Field normalization

Canonical business validation

Output formatting & enrichment
