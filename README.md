DocSynthAI – Intelligent Document Processing MCP Server

DocSynthAI is an open-source Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) engine powered by the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
It converts unstructured documents into structured, validated, business-ready data using OCR, NLP, AI models, and rule-based validation pipelines.

✨ What DocSynthAI Does

Transforms PDFs, images, scanned docs, and text files into structured data

Exposes an MCP server, enabling any LLM/agent/workflow to process documents

Runs a modular IDP pipeline with plug-and-play stages:

OCR

Layout detection

Classification

Entity & table extraction

Field normalization

Canonical business validation

🚀 Core Highlights
⭐ 1. AI-Driven Classification

Detects document types (invoices, KYC, statements, contracts, etc.) with ML + rules.

⭐ 2. Smart Extraction Engine

OCR + NLP extraction with key-value detection, table parsing, and entity recognition.

⭐ 3. Canonical Validation Layer

Applies domain rules, cross-field checks, regulatory patterns, and normalization to produce a consistent schema.

⭐ 4. MCP-Native Integration

Instantly usable with LLMs, agent frameworks, workflow tools, and automation platforms.

⭐ 5. Fully Extensible

Custom extractors, validators, models, and pipelines can be added with minimal effort.
